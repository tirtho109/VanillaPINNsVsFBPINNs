## Domain Decomposition based PINNs approach to solve differential equations.

- Based on the approach by Moseley et al. in [Finite Basis Physics-Informed Neural Networks (FBPINNs): a scalable domain decomposition approach for solving differential equations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-023-10065-9).
- Built our problem on top of the [FBPINNs](https://github.com/benmoseley/FBPINNs) package.
- For better understanding, refer to the code and documentation of the FBPINNs package.
